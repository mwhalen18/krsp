#' Launch the Shiny Squirrels dashboard
#'
#' This Shiny app requires a connection to the KRSP database, which can be
#' accomplished in one of two ways. Either using using `location` to choose
#' one of the predefined connection settings or by setting the database name,
#' host, username, and password directly.
#'
#' @param location string; choose one of the predefined database connection
#'   settings. "local" will connect to a local copy of the database as root user
#'   with no password. "camp" is to be used at camp to connect to the database
#'   on the head tech computer over the local network. If `location` is
#'   set, then all other parameters are ignored.
#' @param dbname string; the name of the database to connect to, typically
#'   "krsp".
#' @param host string; the IP address of the computer hosting the database.
#' @param username string; username for connection.
#' @param password string; password for connection.
