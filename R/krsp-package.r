#' krsp: Working with the Kluane Red Squirrel Project Database
#'
#' This package is designed to help users bring data from the KRSP database into
#' R. In addition, common database queries are standardized as R functions to
#' ensure consistency. Many of the functions are wrappers around `dplyr` or
#' `RMySQL` functions. The vignettes demonstrates the use of this package:
#' `browseVignettes(package = "krsp")`
#'
#' @name krsp
#' @docType package

# R CMD check doesn't like %>%, this fix deals with that
