A data frame allowing identification of squirrels by colours. In this
data frame there are three flags: \code{valid} indicates whether the
colours are valid (allowing for at most 2 colours per ear),
\code{duplicate} indicates whether that combination of colours is used on
multiple squirrels, and \code{standard} indicates whether a squirrel has
standard colouring, i.e. one colour in each ear and no mixing of wires,
pipes, and discs.
