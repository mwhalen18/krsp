\description{
This package is designed to help users bring data from the KRSP database into
R. In addition, common database queries are standardized as R functions to
ensure consistency. Many of the functions are wrappers around \code{dplyr} or
\code{RMySQL} functions. The vignettes demonstrates the use of this package:
\code{browseVignettes(package = "krsp")}
}
