instance of the krsp database these will be user specific and must be
supplied.}

\description{
\code{krsp_connect} is a wrapper for \code{\link[DBI:dbConnect]{DBI::dbConnect()}} that
connects to the KRSP database. By default, this function will connect to a
local copy of the database as root user with no password. When connecting to
a remote database, the host, username, and password must be supplied. This
information can be passed as parameters to \code{krsp_connect}, however, it's
much safer to store these authentication parameters in a my.cnf file. Consult
the vignette for this package for further details.
