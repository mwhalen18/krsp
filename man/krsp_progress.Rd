\usage{
krsp_progress(
  con,
  grid,
  year = current_year(),
  sex = c("F", "M", "Both"),
  data = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{con}{Connection to KRSP database}

\item{grid}{character; one or more grids to search. Defaults to all grids.}

\item{year}{integer; defaults to current year}

\item{sex}{character; whether to return females, males, or both.}

\item{data}{logical; if TRUE return data frame instead of plotting}
}
\value{
Displays and returns a \code{ggvis} plot of seasonal workflow
progress for all squirrels, unless \code{data} is TRUE, in which case a
data frame is returned and nothing is plotted.
}
\description{
Display an interactive visualization of data collection progress for the
season. All adult females and males caught in the given year are inlcuded
provided their most recent trapping record has fate 1-3.
}
\details{
The status of a female is based on the most recent trapping record and the
litter table. If the most recent trapping record is dated prior to the date
the litter table was updated it is ignored, and only the litter table is
used. If nipple condition is 5, the status is LL (Lost Litter). Otherwise,
status is Parturition, N1, or Completed if fieldBDate, date1, or tagDt fields
in litter table are filled in, respectively. Finally, if litter table dates
are empty, rep_con field in trapping record is used and status is P0, P1, P2,
or P3 is assigned for rep_con = 1, 2, 3, 4, respectively.

Males are assigned status "S" or "A" for scrotal or abdominal.
